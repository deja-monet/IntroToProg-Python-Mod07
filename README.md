## Assignment 07: Files & Exceptions

### Introduction

In this assignment, I will review Python exceptions and .dat files.

### Completing the Assignment

This assignment directed students to learn about exception handling and Pickling in Python. My first step was to research what exception handling was, and choose an appropriate script that demonstrated this issue.

The first resource I used to research exception handling was w3schools.com. This resource showed that exceptions can be handled using the try statement (**Figure 1**).
